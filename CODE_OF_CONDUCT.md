# Code of Conduct

Hi there! Since this is my personal hobby project, I want to keep things
simple and friendly. Here are a few guidelines I ask everyone to follow.

## Our Values

I'm building this project for fun and to help others learn. I expect everyone
who participates in this project to be respectful and kind.

## What I Expect From You

- Be respectful to everyone in the community
- Be constructive with feedback
- Be patient - I respond as quickly as I can, but this isn't my job
- Assume good intentions from others

## What You Can Expect From Me

- I'll respond to issues and PRs when I have time
- I'll treat everyone with respect
- I'll explain my decisions when I make changes or rejections
- I'm learning too, so I appreciate feedback on my code and processes

## Unacceptable Behavior

I won't tolerate:

- Harassment or discrimination of any kind
- Personal attacks or insults
- Spam or self-promotion
- Any behavior that makes others feel unwelcome

## Reporting Issues

If someone is making you feel uncomfortable, please let me know. You can:

- Report the issue via GitHub's reporting tools
- Contact me directly (check my GitHub profile for contact info)

I take these reports seriously and will address them as quickly as I can.

## Consequences

If I find that someone is violating these standards, I may:

- Give them a warning
- Remove their comments or issues
- Ban them from the repository

I want this to be a welcoming space for everyone who wants to participate.

Thanks for helping me keep this community friendly and inclusive!
